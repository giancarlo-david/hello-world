# hello-world
First repository

Hello my name is Giancarlo David, currently a junior at Texas State University
I started this GitHub account to host my code as I am tired of carrying my flash drive around
Currently I believe my strongest language to be C++.
I learned Python over the spring of 2019 using my friend's homework assignments for a python class
Currentltly I am learning C#
